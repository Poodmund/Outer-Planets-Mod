# Outer Planets Mod v2.2.9

This version of Outer Planets Mod has been built to work for KSP version 1.3.1 - 1.11.*.

### 1 - About

The Outer Planets Mod is a mod that expands the outer edges of the Kerbol system to create something akin to the real Solar System's. It adds Kerbalized versions of Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto as well as several of these planets' moons. These faraway planets provide a challenge rarely encountered in Kerbal Space Program; you'll have to figure out new transfer windows, manage your power supply differently, provide your spacecraft with more Delta-V and be ready to travel years or even decades.

### 2 - Features

* Explore 15 new highly detailed planets and moons, all in a stock-a-like artstyle.
* Discover never before seen worlds, such as a sub-satellite, Trojan moon or a set of binary bodies.
* Collect science in over 140 biomes, with almost a thousand unique science blurbs.
* Custom terrain textures and improved ground scatter has made planets and moons never look so good up close.
* A full set of KSPedia entries for OPM's various bodies helps you to navigate the far reaches of the Kerbol system.
* Includes a Level 4 Tracking Station upgrade (requires CustomBarnKit) to boost your communication range out to the furthest reaches of the system without requiring additional modded antennas.
* Extensive third-party mod integration means you can play OPM with a whole range of other mods.

### 3 - Known Issues

* None at this time

### 4 - How to Install

### 7 - Changelog

v2.2.9

* Fixed contracts from spawning requiring players to drill Ore from gas giants.
* Increased Neidon and Plock's (plus moons) Science Recovery Values slightly to increase their contract duration times. Hopefully this increase in potential science gain around Neidon and Plock will not unbalance the tech tree progression rate.
